# Multi Aget System approach to simulate COVID-19 spreading

Epidemic of COVID-19 has a significant impact on people's lifestyle all over the world. It has paralyzed economic situation of many countries and lowered the sense of security of whole societies. One of possible solutions to fight against this pandemic reality, that the governments can undertake, is to impose several social restrictions. In this study, we propose a Agent-Based model, which we will use to evaluate the influence of those restrictions on the COVID-19 spreading. The model is based on previous research regarding social contacts between people in four age groups (Child, Young, Mid, Old), the impact of disease on people in different ages. We also will perform a list of experiments with different behavioral scenarios. We believe, that this approach will give a clear view on which restrictions are helpful to deal with epidemic, and what are the consequences of not following the suggested limitations.


## How to start a simulation

- Make sure you have Python 3.7.6 installed
- `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python launchModel.py`
